Call Stack:

View the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls leading up to the current point in the program.
Variables:

Inspect and modify variable values during debugging. The Variables panel shows the current state of variables.
Debug Console:

Execute commands and evaluate expressions at runtime. The Debug Console allows for real-time interaction with your program.
Step Controls:

Control the execution flow with Step Over (F10), Step Into (F11), Step Out (Shift+F11), and Continue (F5).
